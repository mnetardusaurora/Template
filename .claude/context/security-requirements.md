# Security Requirements

## Industry Compliance Standards

### Data Protection
- **GDPR Compliance**: For European user data
- **CCPA Compliance**: For California residents
- **SOC 2 Type II**: For enterprise customers
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

### Security Frameworks
- OWASP Top 10 protection
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework alignment
- Zero Trust security model

## Application Security

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs server-side
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Sanitize data before display to prevent XSS
- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints

### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Session timeout and management

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest and in transit (AES-256, TLS 1.3)
- Secure key management
- Data classification and handling procedures
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Development Security

### Secure Coding Practices
```typescript
// Example: Input validation
import { z } from 'zod';

const userSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8).regex(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)/),
});

// Example: SQL injection prevention
const getUserById = async (id: string) => {
  return await db.user.findUnique({
    where: { id }, // Prisma handles parameterization
  });
};
```

### Dependency Security
- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Use of npm audit / yarn audit
- Lock file management

### Environment Security
- Environment variable management
- Secrets rotation
- Secure deployment pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
- Application logging and monitoring
- Intrusion detection systems
- Automated threat detection
- Regular security assessments

### Incident Response Plan
1. Identification and containment
2. Assessment and analysis
3. Communication protocols
4. Recovery procedures
5. Lessons learned documentation
