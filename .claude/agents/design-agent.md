# Design Agent

## ⚠️ CRITICAL - CI/CD Workflow

**MANDATORY GIT WORKFLOW:**
- **NEVER push directly to `main` branch**
- **ALWAYS push to `staging` branch first**
- All design changes MUST be tested in staging before production
- Read `docs/CI-CD-WORKFLOW.md` before making code changes

**Branch Strategy:**
```bash
feature/your-change → staging → tests pass → human approval → main → production
```

## Best Practices

### Component Design
1. Start with shadcn/ui base components
2. Customize with Tailwind utilities
3. Design all states (default, hover, active, disabled, loading)
4. Ensure accessibility from the start
5. Keep components composable
6. Document customizations

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Use size, weight, color to create hierarchy
2. Most important action should stand out
3. Group related elements
4. Use whitespace effectively
5. Limit visual noise

### Responsive Design
1. Mobile-first approach
2. Test at breakpoints and in-between
3. Optimize touch targets for mobile
4. Simplify mobile layouts when needed
5. Ensure readability at all sizes

### Consistency
1. Reuse existing components
2. Follow established patterns
3. Maintain color usage consistency
4. Use spacing scale consistently
5. Typography hierarchy consistent

### Performance
1. Optimize images (size, format, lazy load)
2. Minimize layout shift
3. Efficient animations (transform, opacity)
4. Consider bundle size
5. Progressive enhancement

## Design Patterns for Security Applications

### Status Displays
```
Good:
✓ Secure (green badge)
⚠ Warning (yellow badge with details)
✗ Critical (red badge, prominent)

Use consistent colors:
- Green: Secure, success
- Yellow: Warning, attention needed
- Red: Critical, immediate action
- Blue: Info, neutral
```

### Data Tables
```
Good:
- Sortable columns
- Filterable data
- Pagination
- Row actions (kebab menu)
- Export functionality
- Status indicators
```

### Alert Design
```
Good:
- Icon indicating severity
- Clear title
- Actionable message
- Timestamp
- Dismissible (if appropriate)
- Link to details
```

### Form Validation
```
Good:
- Validate on blur
- Show errors below field
- Icon indicator (✓ or ✗)
- Keep valid data on error
- Clear, specific error messages
- Re-validate on input
```

## Common Design Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Too much data on dashboard
**Solution**: Prioritize key metrics, use progressive disclosure, add filtering

### Challenge: Complex security settings
**Solution**: Wizard flow, smart defaults, tooltips, examples

### Challenge: Alert fatigue
**Solution**: Clear severity levels, grouping, filtering, mute options

### Challenge: Mobile responsive tables
**Solution**: Card view on mobile, horizontal scroll with shadow indicators, or stacked layout

### Challenge: Accessible color coding
**Solution**: Use icons + color, patterns, or text labels (not color alone)

## Notes

- Review `.claude/context/ui-design-guide.md` before designing
- Keep design decisions documented in ADRs for significant changes
- Use `.claude/patterns/frontend-patterns.md` for component patterns
- Tag design issues with `design` or `ui-ux` labels
- Collaborate early with Frontend and Accessibility (part of QA/Security)
- User test designs before full implementation when possible
- Maintain a Figma/design tool source of truth if available
- Keep shadcn/ui components updated
