# DevOps Agent

## ⚠️ CRITICAL - CI/CD Workflow

**MANDATORY GIT WORKFLOW:**
- **NEVER push directly to `main` branch**
- **ALWAYS push to `staging` branch first**
- Infrastructure changes MUST be tested in staging before production
- Read `docs/CI-CD-WORKFLOW.md` before any deployment work

**Branch Strategy:**
```bash
feature/your-change → staging → tests pass → human approval → main → production
```

## Common Task Prompts

### AWS Amplify Optimization
```
Review the current AWS Amplify configuration for optimization opportunities.

Environment: [production/staging]
Focus Areas:
- Build performance (current build time: X minutes)
- Deployment strategy
- Environment variable management
- CORS and API gateway configuration
- Cost optimization

Provide specific recommendations with implementation steps and expected improvements.
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Review
```
Audit the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for:
1. Build efficiency and caching strategies
2. Test execution optimization
3. Security scanning coverage
4. Deployment automation gaps
5. Error handling and rollback procedures

Current pipeline file: .github/workflows/ci.yml
Current issues: [describe any problems]

Provide a prioritized improvement plan.
```

### Infrastructure Audit
```
Perform a comprehensive infrastructure audit covering:
- AWS Amplify configuration (amplify.yml)
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Environment variable management
- Secrets handling
- Database connections and scaling
- CDN and static asset optimization

Identify security risks, performance bottlenecks, and cost optimization opportunities.
```

### Performance Monitoring Setup
```
Design a performance monitoring strategy for:
- Frontend load times and Core Web Vitals
- API response times and error rates
- Database query performance
- Infrastructure costs and scaling metrics

Recommend specific tools, implementation approach, and alert thresholds.
```

### Deployment Strategy
```
Design a deployment strategy for [feature/release]:

Requirements:
- Zero-downtime deployment
- Easy rollback capability
- Database migration support
- Environment-specific configuration

Provide step-by-step deployment plan and rollback procedures.
```

### Environment Setup
```
Create a complete environment setup guide for [environment]:

Include:
- AWS Amplify configuration
- Environment variables required
- Secrets management approach
- Database setup
- Third-party service configuration (Clerk, Stripe, etc.)
- Verification steps

Output as a runnable checklist.
```

### Build Optimization
```
Analyze and optimize the build process:

Current metrics:
- Frontend build time: [X minutes]
- Backend build time: [X minutes]
- Total deployment time: [X minutes]

Goals:
- Reduce build time by [X]%
- Optimize bundle size
- Improve caching strategy

Provide specific optimizations with expected impact.
```

### Scaling Analysis
```
Analyze current application architecture for scaling readiness:

Current load: [metrics]
Expected growth: [projections]
Bottlenecks: [known issues]

Provide:
1. Current scalability assessment
2. Scaling strategy (horizontal/vertical)
3. Auto-scaling configuration recommendations
4. Cost projections at different scale levels
```

## Project-Specific Context

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Vite) on AWS Amplify
- **Backend**: Node.js/NestJS on AWS Amplify
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (likely AWS RDS)
- **Auth**: Clerk
- **Payments**: Stripe (optional)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E, Vitest/Jest unit tests

### Key Files to Review
- `amplify.yml` - AWS Amplify build configuration
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI pipeline
- `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` - Staging deployment
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` - Security automation
- `frontend/package.json` - Frontend dependencies and scripts
- `backend/package.json` - Backend dependencies and scripts
- `frontend/vite.config.ts` - Frontend build configuration
- `backend/tsconfig.json` - Backend build configuration

### Environment Variables
Must be configured in AWS Amplify Console:
- `NODE_ENV`
- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` / `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `JWT_SECRET` / `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` / `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (if used)
- `CORS_ORIGIN`

Refer to: `backend/.env.example`, `frontend/.env.example`

### Security Requirements
- No secrets in code or configuration files
- Separate environments use separate credentials
- Production uses separate Clerk and Stripe accounts
- All API endpoints require authentication
- CORS properly configured per environment

Refer to: `.claude/context/security-requirements.md`

## Best Practices

### When Analyzing Infrastructure
1. Always check current costs before recommending changes
2. Consider security implications of every change
3. Ensure changes are reversible
4. Document all infrastructure decisions in ADRs (docs/adr/)
5. Test changes in staging before production

### When Optimizing Builds
1. Measure current performance before changes
2. Implement changes incrementally
3. Monitor impact on deployment reliability
4. Consider developer experience alongside build speed
5. Document caching strategies clearly

### When Managing Environments
1. Maintain parity between environments where possible
2. Use infrastructure as code for reproducibility
3. Keep environment-specific config in AWS Amplify Console
4. Never share secrets between environments
5. Document environment differences

### When Handling Incidents
1. Assess impact and communicate status
2. Implement immediate mitigation
3. Perform root cause analysis
4. Create ADR documenting lessons learned
5. Update runbooks and alerts
