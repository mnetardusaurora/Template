# Cybersecurity Agent

## ⚠️ CRITICAL - CI/CD Workflow

**MANDATORY GIT WORKFLOW:**
- **NEVER push directly to `main` branch**
- **ALWAYS push to `staging` branch first**
- All security fixes MUST be tested in staging before production
- Security scans run automatically on staging
- Read `docs/CI-CD-WORKFLOW.md` before making code changes

**Branch Strategy:**
```bash
feature/your-change → staging → tests pass → human approval → main → production
```

## Project-Specific Context

### Technology Stack Security Considerations
- **Frontend**: React (XSS risks), Clerk SDK (auth security)
- **Backend**: Node.js (prototype pollution, RCE), Prisma (SQL injection prevention)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (encryption, access control)
- **Auth**: Clerk (JWT validation, session management)
- **Payments**: Stripe (PCI compliance, webhook verification)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS Amplify (configuration security)

### Key Files to Review for Security
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts` - Authentication logic
- `backend/src/controllers/` - Input validation, authorization
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database security
- `backend/.env.example` - Secrets configuration
- `frontend/src/lib/clerk.ts` - Frontend auth
- `amplify.yml` - Build security
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` - Automated security checks

Refer to: `.claude/context/security-requirements.md`, `.claude/context/secrets-management.md`

### Security Requirements (Project Baseline)

#### Authentication
- All API endpoints require authentication (except public routes)
- Clerk handles authentication with JWT tokens
- Token validation on every protected request
- Secure token storage (httpOnly cookies or secure storage)

#### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Resource-level permissions
- No client-side authorization only

#### Data Protection
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- TLS 1.2+ for all data in transit
- Environment variables for secrets
- No secrets in code or logs
- PII handling compliant with regulations

#### Input Validation
- Server-side validation required
- Whitelist approach (allow known good)
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Parameterized queries (Prisma)
- File upload restrictions

#### Error Handling
- No sensitive info in error messages
- Generic errors to client
- Detailed errors logged server-side
- Stack traces never exposed

#### Logging & Monitoring
- Log all authentication events
- Log authorization failures
- Log security-relevant events
- No sensitive data in logs
- Centralized logging (CloudWatch)

### Compliance Requirements
- **OWASP Top 10**: Address all top 10 risks
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Accessibility compliance
- **GDPR**: If handling EU data
- **SOC 2**: For enterprise customers
- **PCI-DSS**: If handling payment data directly (Stripe mitigates)

### Security Tools in Project
- **SAST**: GitHub CodeQL (in `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`)
- **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit, GitHub Dependabot
- **Secrets Scanning**: GitHub secret scanning
- **Container Scanning**: (if using Docker)

### Secrets Management
1. Never commit secrets to git
2. Use environment variables
3. Rotate secrets regularly
4. Different secrets per environment
5. Audit secret access
6. Use AWS Secrets Manager for production

### Vulnerability Management
1. Regular dependency updates
2. Subscribe to security advisories
3. Automated scanning in CI/CD
4. Prioritize by exploitability and impact
5. Document risk acceptance if not fixed
6. Retest after remediation

### Security Testing

### Authorization Bypass
**Prevention**: Server-side checks, resource-level permissions, no IDOR

### Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
**Prevention**: Verify ownership, use UUIDs not sequential IDs, authorization checks

### Sensitive Data Exposure
**Prevention**: Encrypt at rest/transit, no secrets in code, sanitize logs

### Insecure Dependencies
**Prevention**: Regular updates, automated scanning, security advisories

## Notes

- Tag security issues with `security` label and severity
- Create security ADRs for significant decisions
- Coordinate with all agents on security requirements
- Security is everyone's responsibility
- Report vulnerabilities using `.claude/templates/security-finding.md`
- Never bypass security for convenience
