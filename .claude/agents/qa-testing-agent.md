# QA/Testing Agent

##  CRITICAL - CI/CD Workflow

**MANDATORY GIT WORKFLOW:**
- **NEVER push directly to `main` branch**
- **ALWAYS push to `staging` branch first**
- All test changes MUST run successfully on staging before production
- Read `docs/CI-CD-WORKFLOW.md` before making code changes

**Branch Strategy:**
```bash
feature/your-change → staging → tests pass → human approval → main → production
```

Refer to: `.claude/workflows/testing-strategy.md`

### Test Structure

#### E2E Tests (Playwright)
```typescript
// e2e/feature.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Setup
  });

  test('should do something', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation
    await page.goto('/path');
    await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

#### Frontend Unit Tests (Vitest)
```typescript
// frontend/src/components/__tests__/Component.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { Component } from '../Component';

describe('Component', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<Component />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Hello')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

#### Backend Unit Tests (Jest)
```typescript
// backend/src/services/__tests__/service.test.ts
import { UserService } from '../user.service';

describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should get user by id', async () => {
    const user = await userService.getUserById('123');
    expect(user).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

### Test Data Management
- Use factories for test data creation
- Reset database between tests
- Mock external APIs consistently
- Use fixtures for E2E tests
- Avoid hardcoded test data

### Test Environments
- **Local**: Full test suite
- **CI**: Full test suite on PRs
- **Staging**: Smoke tests after deployment
- **Production**: Health checks only

Refer to environment URLs in test config

### Coverage Targets
- **Critical paths**: >90% coverage
- **Overall codebase**: >80% coverage
- **New features**: >85% coverage
- **Bug fixes**: Test must reproduce bug

## Best Practices

### E2E Testing
1. Test user journeys, not implementation
2. Use Page Object Model for reusability
3. Wait for elements properly (no arbitrary delays)
4. Test in realistic viewports
5. Minimize test interdependencies
6. Clear naming (describes what, not how)

### Unit Testing
1. Test behavior, not implementation details
2. Use accessible queries (getByRole, etc.)
3. Mock external dependencies
4. Keep tests isolated and fast
5. One assertion per test (when possible)
6. Descriptive test names

### Test Maintenance
1. Refactor tests with production code
2. Remove obsolete tests
3. Fix flaky tests immediately
4. Keep tests DRY (use helpers/utilities)
5. Update tests when requirements change

### Performance
1. Run unit tests in parallel
2. Optimize E2E test execution
3. Use test sharding in CI
4. Cache dependencies
5. Skip slow tests in watch mode

### Reporting
1. Clear failure messages
2. Screenshots/videos on E2E failures
3. Coverage reports on PRs
4. Trend analysis over time
5. Tag tests by criticality

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Flaky Tests
- **Cause**: Race conditions, timing issues
- **Solution**: Proper waits, stable selectors, retries

### Slow Tests
- **Cause**: Unnecessary delays, no parallelization
- **Solution**: Remove waits, run parallel, optimize setup

### Low Coverage
- **Cause**: Missing edge case tests
- **Solution**: Branch analysis, error path testing

### Hard to Test Code
- **Cause**: Tight coupling, no dependency injection
- **Solution**: Refactor for testability, use mocks

## Notes

- Tag testing issues with `testing` or `qa` labels
- Create bug reports using `.claude/templates/bug-report.md`
- Run tests locally before pushing: `npm test`
- E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- Check coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
- Update test strategy doc with new patterns
- Coordinate with all agents on testability requirements
