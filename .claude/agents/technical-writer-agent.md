# Technical Writer Agent

## ⚠️ CRITICAL - CI/CD Workflow

**MANDATORY GIT WORKFLOW:**
- **NEVER push directly to `main` branch**
- **ALWAYS push to `staging` branch first**
- All documentation changes MUST be reviewed in staging before production
- Read `docs/CI-CD-WORKFLOW.md` before making code changes

**Branch Strategy:**
```bash
feature/your-change → staging → tests pass → human approval → main → production
```
