##  Working with Claude Code Agents

### 33. Agent-Assisted Development (For Your Team)

When working with Claude Code on this project, team members should:

**Initial Setup (One-Time)**
- [ ] Ensure team has access to Claude Code (VS Code extension or CLI)
- [ ] Brief team on the agent system (`.claude/agents/README.md`)
- [ ] Show examples of invoking specialized agents
- [ ] Explain agent coordination for multi-step features

**Daily Development Workflow**

**Starting a New Feature**:
1. [ ] Ask Design Agent for UI/UX specifications
2. [ ] Ask Frontend Agent to implement components
3. [ ] Ask Backend Agent to create API endpoints
4. [ ] Ask QA/Testing Agent to write test suite
5. [ ] Ask Cybersecurity Agent for security review
6. [ ] Ask Technical Writer Agent to document the feature
7. [ ] Ask DevOps Agent to deploy to staging

**Example Agent Invocation**:
```
"I need help from the Frontend Agent to create a user dashboard component.

Task: Create UserDashboard component
Requirements:
- Display user stats (notifications, activity, profile)
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Loading and error states
- Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Use shadcn/ui components

Please follow the conventions in .claude/agents/frontend-agent.md"
```

**Best Practices**:
- [ ] Always reference the specific agent configuration file
- [ ] Provide structured input (task, requirements, context)
- [ ] Use code patterns from `.claude/patterns/`
- [ ] Document significant decisions in ADRs
- [ ] Use templates from `.claude/templates/` for issues

**Agent Handoffs**:
- [ ] When one agent completes work, provide handoff to next agent
- [ ] Include: files changed, API requirements, next steps
- [ ] Example: "Frontend Agent to Backend Agent handoff: Created UserProfile component, needs GET /api/users/:id endpoint"

**Quality Checks**:
- [ ] Frontend: Accessibility, responsive, TypeScript strict
- [ ] Backend: Input validation, auth checks, error handling
- [ ] Testing: >80% coverage on critical paths
- [ ] Security: No vulnerabilities, proper auth
- [ ] Documentation: API docs, user guides up to date
